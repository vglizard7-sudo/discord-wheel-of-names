## Troubleshooting

### "Uplup API not configured"
Make sure you've added both `UPLUP_API_KEY` and `UPLUP_API_SECRET` to your `.env` file.

### "This command requires Uplup API integration"
The `/wheel` commands need API keys configured. The `/spin` commands work without API keys.

### Bot doesn't respond to commands
1. Make sure you ran `npm run deploy` after any command changes
2. Check that the bot has proper permissions in the channel
3. Verify the bot is online (green status)

### "Missing Server Members Intent"
Enable **Server Members Intent** in Discord Developer Portal > Bot settings.
